# Get Into My Head

With VR technology, we are now one step closer to better understanding what people suffering from depression feels.

## Inspiration
So meet Isabella - 19 years old, smart, pretty, popular.
But what most don't know, is that she has been diagnosed with depression.

Statistics tell us that she's like 2 of the roughly 40 of us in this very room - clinically diagnosed with depression at some point.
Don't worry - I'm one of those 2.

Anyway, her loving parents, Andrew and May, started following her to see a psychiatrist. Beyond that, they're at a loss at how they can help their daughter.
They can't comprehend how Isabella, who seemingly loved life, is suddenly dead inside.

So the problem is - how do her parents understand what she's going through?

Here's our solution.

At an appointment with her psychiatrist, Andrew and May are passed a Virtual Reality headset that will transport them to their daughter's world.

VR experiences are ordinarily empowering - your abilities are enhanced as compared to reality.
But here, you're oppressed by the lack of motivation that follows depression.
Doing even the simplest thing is exponentially harder than it should be.

May tries the headset first.

Now, a concerned friend is checking up on May/Isabella. She has a choice to make.
Does she share about her depression and risk being a burden to her friend?
Does she lie, and say she's fine?
Or does she do nothing and let her friendship slowly die?

May's decides to tell the truth.
Now this is where it gets interesting.

It's a simple message to type for most of us, but for her she's fighting with every keystroke.
To empathize, May has to hit the choice button faster and faster to simulate the effort it would take Isabella.
The closer she gets, the harder she has to fight against the voices in her head.

The rest of the experience involves going through similar mundane activities while battling her demons.

See, daily tasks are easy for most people.
Getting up in the morning.
Taking a shower.
Replying to that text message.

But for the depressed it can be like trying to run underwater. We're making that more understandable, so that their loved ones can interact with them more comfortably.


## How we built it
Using Unity and Google Daydream

## Challenges we ran into
Leaning the control and interface of Daydream

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It's our first project in VR, we are proud we are able to complete it.

## What we learned
Google Daydream, teamwork, mental health issue in Singapore.

## What's next for Get Into My Head

VR experiences for other mental afflictions such as Schizophrenia or Bipolar can eventually be created as well.
So here's a good idea - using the immersive VR to better understand the difficulties our loved ones face.
